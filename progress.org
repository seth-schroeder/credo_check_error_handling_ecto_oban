        - significant effort required to fix this
        - with error handling and Multi.new in separate functions, the linter would have to
          become more of an interpreter. Or a terribly messy linter that tries to do too much.
    - [ ] false negatives
      - hard to find in the wild
      - hard to recreate manually
      - for "the future"
  - [ ] cross link old repo
    - [ ] publish to mix
    - [ ] submit PRs for the true positives
  - [X] write local script to regression test these repos
* TODO nice to haves [50%]
  - [X] config option for the module name of ~Repo~
    - in practice it has been fine to look for ~repo~ or ~Repo~
  - [ ] property testing for aliasing & free/pro Oban
